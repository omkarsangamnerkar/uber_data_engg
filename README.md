# ETL Project: Uber Fare Data Pipeline and Analysis

This project focuses on building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for Uber's data using Mage AI's custom loader to extract data from Google Cloud Storage, transforming it using a custom transformer block, and exporting it to BigQuery. The transformed data is then analyzed using BigQuery for analytics and visualized using Looker. Additionally, facts and dimensions are created to enhance the understanding and analysis of the data.

## Project Overview

The ETL pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from Google Cloud Storage using Mage AI's custom loader.

2. **Transformation**: The extracted data undergoes transformation using a custom transformer block to ensure consistency and compatibility with the target system.

3. **Export**: The transformed data is exported to Google BigQuery.

4. **Analytics**: The exported data is loaded into BigQuery for advanced analytics, querying, and insights generation.

5. **Visualization**: The analyzed data is visualized using Looker, allowing stakeholders to explore and interpret the data through intuitive dashboards and reports.

## Key Components

- **Mage AI Custom Loader**: Enables seamless extraction of data from Google Cloud Storage with customizable options for data retrieval.

- **Custom Transformer Block**: Facilitates the transformation of extracted data into a format suitable for analysis and further processing.

- **BigQuery**: Google Cloud's fully managed data warehouse for storing and analyzing large datasets using SQL queries.

- **Looker**: A modern business intelligence and analytics platform that provides interactive dashboards and visualizations for data exploration.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the data pipeline process from extraction to visualization, reducing manual efforts and ensuring data consistency.

- **Scalability**: The cloud-based architecture allows for scaling resources based on data volume and processing requirements.

- **Insights Generation**: Enables data-driven decision-making by providing actionable insights through advanced analytics and visualization.

- **Data Governance**: Establishes a structured approach to data management, including the creation of facts and dimensions for better understanding and analysis.

## Conclusion

The ETL pipeline for customer data offers a robust framework for extracting, transforming, and loading data, enabling organizations to derive valuable insights and drive business growth. By leveraging Mage AI, Google Cloud, BigQuery, and Looker, businesses can optimize their data operations and unlock the full potential of their data assets.
